<h2> COVID-19 modeller and tracker </h2><br>
This github page contains the codes for a synergetic R-Shiny portal for modeling and tracking of COVID-19 demographic information.
The data used are obtained from the online repository GitHub (https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json) 
which transforms the data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) into a json file.
This Shiny app, first released on 6 April 2020, to serve as a platform for visualization 
and analysis of the data. Analysis here includes logistic and Gompertz growth models, as two mathematical tools for predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
as well as the  Moran's index metric, which gives a spatial correlation of the contries of a given continent.
